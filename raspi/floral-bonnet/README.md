# Raspi floral bonnet playing around

Developed on the raspberry pi floral bonnet (distributed at LCA 2019)

I didn't attend the sessions and there doesn't seem to be much documentation on this hardware.
so I've been looking at DavidAntliff/pi-floral for how to get started.
Also a lot of adafruit tutorials, since the parts looks like a lot fo adafruit stuff.

Schematic is here: https://github.com/unreproducible/bonnet_floral

## Display

Tutorial: https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts/python-usage-2
The floral bonnet uses SPI to connect to the display. 128 x 64 pixels.


DavidAntliff's code seems to use the older adafruit library described here: https://learn.adafruit.com/ssd1306-oled-displays-with-raspberry-pi-and-beaglebone-black/usage
