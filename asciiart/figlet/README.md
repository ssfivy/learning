# figlet - Generate ASCII banners

Use this program to generate ASCII banners. Useful for log banners.

Original site: http://www.figlet.org/

Pure-python reimplementation: https://github.com/pwaller/pyfiglet

The figlet install in Ubuntu does not seem to contain all the fonts available in the website.

There is another program `TOIlet`, which does similar things.

Another interesting project is `cowsay` and `fortune`,
