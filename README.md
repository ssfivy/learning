# learning

Collection of attempts in learning new technologies. Inspired by scottslowe/learning-tools

This is the place where I put in various little scripts / exercises that I did whenever I discover something interesting. Not everything is here however.

Maybe I should make a table of contents here (automatically?). Until then feel free to browse the directories.

Everything here is MIT-licensed, unless stated otherwise in the specific folders.
