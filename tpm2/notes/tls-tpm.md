# Collections of URLS and notes for TLS+TPM stuff

# Official / introductory resources
TPM spec is really dry, I will not bother with it.

There is an open access book that is less dry than the official spec, but it does not tell you how to use the TPM at all.

A much better introduction would be Andreas Fuch's presentation slides from CCC.

There is a very well written question that describes someone's quest to use TPM2 from C# on Microsoft. While it is not applicable to Linux development and is rather outdated (written in 2015, last updates ~2018), it is describing a lot of things that we would like to do with TPM2 and is a nice read.

# https://github.com/tpm2-software resources

This is the software we are using. General documenttion is unfortunately very sparse.

Note that part of this official group is the Python bindings fot TSS: https://tpm2-software.github.io/tpm2-pytss/

# Infineon resources

This is an excellent manual on installing and playing with the tpm2-software, even more detailed than the official documentations. Also includes instructions on how to program against the tpm2 libraries.
https://www.infineon.com/TPM-TSS-AppNote

This is an application note on integration of Infineon's TPM with OpenSSL.
Includes openssl configuration, certificate generations, and testing with openssl's builtin webserver.
Also includes a howto manual on how to sniff traffic using tshark

# Nginx resources
This issue documents someone's step-by-step successful attempts to use TPM as the ssl engine in nginx: https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss-engine/issues/91

# Golang resources
Go has two packages for interacting with TPM, one from Google and one from Canonical. We prefer the Google one since it is likely to have production use in GCP, plus the canonical one is LGPLV3(with link exception).
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/go-tpm/tpm2?tab=doc
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/canonical/go-tpm2?tab=doc

Google also have a library containing some higher level API:
https://github.com/google/go-tpm-tools

There is also a bloke which probably works for Google and wrote a shit ton of examples on how to use these libraries, with comparison on how to do it with CLI tools (which could be a good example on how to use the CLI tools)

Note that combined with its built-in crypto and web libraries (both robust enough to be used without any reverse proxy in front [1], [2]), Go looks very appealing as the language for anything that needs TLS and TPM functionality.

[1] Don't believe me? See the following links. Just don't forget to configure the timeouts!

[2] See also caddy web server, which has ultra-easy to setup e.g. built-in TLS by default including automated let's encrypt renewals. And it's basically "a glorified wrapper over Goâ€™s net/http and crypto/tls packages", according to the author.

# Rust resources
Looks like the only thing that talks TPM in Rust is this one crate. Support does not seem to be as wide as golang.

# Outdated but still potentially useful

A bloke added TPM backed SSL to his codebase about 8 years ago.
Notable that it includes actual benchmarking data (0.7s / handshake).

ONAP TPM / HSM analysis. Contains analysis of the state of open source implementations. A bit unintuitive, but maybe useful if we go down further. Circa 2018.

Two posts about using hardware modules to back mbedTLS.
The response circa 2018 is that you need to add your own implementations. This sounds rather painful so I am not sure this is a good approach.
